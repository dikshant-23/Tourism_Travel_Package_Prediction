# Tourism_Travel_Package_Prediction

### Background and Context 
As a Data Scientist at "Visit with Us" tourism company, I have been tasked with helping to expand the customer base and establish a profitable business model. The company currently offers five packages - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King - and 18% of customers purchased these packages last year. However, the marketing efforts were not cost-effective because they were not targeted and were done without considering customer information.

To make the marketing efforts more efficient, the company plans to launch a new Wellness Tourism Package, which is designed to help travelers maintain or improve their well-being and health. To achieve this goal, the company wants to harness available customer data to make more informed decisions and improve marketing efforts.

As a Data Scientist, I will analyze the existing customer data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team. Additionally, I will build a model to predict which customers are most likely to purchase the new travel package. This will help the company make the most of its marketing expenditure and expand its customer base effectively
